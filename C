# Habitao - Planned Features & Task Breakdown

**Last Updated:** February 23, 2026
**Status:** Active Planning

---

## Priority 1: Performance Optimization

### 1.1 Calendar Widget (Replace LazyRow with HorizontalPager)
**Branch:** `feature/calendar-optimization`
**Effort:** Small (1 session)
- Replace LazyRow in HabitsScreen with HorizontalPager for week-based swiping
- Use large page count with middle-index centering for infinite scroll illusion
- Pre-calculate calendar data in ViewModel (not in Composable)
- Add snap-to-week physics
- Limit visible range to reasonable bounds (no Int.MAX_VALUE items)

### 1.2 Compose Recomposition Optimization
**Branch:** `feature/performance`
**Effort:** Medium (1-2 sessions)
- Audit all screens for unnecessary recompositions using Layout Inspector
- Convert direct state reads to lambda-based modifiers where applicable
- Add `key` parameters to all LazyColumn/LazyRow items
- Use `derivedStateOf` for scroll-dependent state (e.g., show/hide buttons)
- Defer rapidly-changing state reads (timer seconds) to Layout phase
- Add Baseline Profiles for critical user paths

### 1.3 General Performance
**Branch:** `feature/performance`
**Effort:** Small (1 session)
- Review all ViewModels for heavy operations on main thread
- Ensure all database operations use IO dispatcher
- Review image loading and memory usage
- Profile cold start time and optimize if needed

## Priority 2: Pomodoro UX Enhancements

### 2.1 Task Association (Link Pomodoro to Tasks)
**Branch:** `feature/pomodoro-tasks`
**Effort:** Large (2-3 sessions)
**Depends on:** Tasks module being implemented
- Add optional "task" field to PomodoroSession model
- Before starting timer, show task selector (list of active tasks)
- Allow starting without a task ("Free focus")
- Track total Pomodoro time per task
- Show per-task focus time in task detail view

### 2.2 Full-Screen / Desk Clock Mode
**Branch:** `feature/pomodoro-fullscreen`
**Effort:** Medium (1-2 sessions)

### 2.3 Timer Animations
**Branch:** `feature/pomodoro-animations`
**Effort:** Medium (1-2 sessions)

  - Shrinking circle (current, polish it)
  - Growing plant/tree (Forest-style, simpler version)
  - Filling hourglass
- Let user choose animation style in settings
- Use Compose Canvas for custom drawing
- Ensure animations don't cause jank (use lambda-based state reads)

### 2.4 Focus Sounds / White Noise
**Branch:** `feature/pomodoro-sounds`
**Effort:** Medium (1-2 sessions)
- Add ambient sound player (rain, cafe, forest, ocean)
- Bundle 4-5 short audio loops as raw resources
